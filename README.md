# Data-Mining-Project
**Loan Approval Prediction**
This project predicts the approval status of loan applications using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. It leverages models such as XGBoost, Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and a Stacked Ensemble (XGBoost + LightGBM + CatBoost), with enhanced feature engineering including K-Means clustering and financial ratio features. The model performance is evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and ROC AUC, and the solution is deployed with a user-friendly Streamlit web interface.


**Techniques Used:** XGBoost, GNN, Stacked Ensemble, SMOTE, K-Means, Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV)

**Feature Engineering:** Total Income, Loan-to-Income Ratio, Income Per Dependent

**Tools:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, PyTorch Geometric, Orange, Streamlit, Google Colab

**Deployment:** Streamlit web interface (hosted via Ngrok) for real-time predictions
